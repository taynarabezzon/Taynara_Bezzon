# Hi, I'm Taynara Bezzon 👋

**Data Analyst | Chemical Engineer | Data Science Specialist**

I bridge the gap between complex industrial processes and data-driven strategy. [cite_start]With a solid foundation in **Chemical Engineering** and a **Postgraduate degree in Data Science & Advanced Analytics**[cite: 52, 100], I specialize in transforming raw datasets into actionable business insights.

[cite_start]Currently, at **3M**, I focus on structuring technical data, monitoring KPIs, and developing strategic dashboards to support high-level decision-making[cite: 56, 117].
